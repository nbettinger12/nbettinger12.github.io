<p>
As you may have guessed, the ever slimming population of pirates on our beloved planet has been directly correlated to the growing Global Average Temperature, also known as global warming. Whilst we would like to believe that the decreasing population of pirates can be seen as a positive happening, the fact of the matter is that if we do not help the pirate population our world could be facing an ever impending doom.
</p>
<p>
Referring to the graph that has been ever so graciously provided by the Pastafi's, it is clear to the simplest of minds that the pirate population must be helped in order for the global warming to halt its progression. While the idea of helping the pirate population is a no-brainer, it is very much easier said than done. This evidence is has motivated and compelled us at SealTeamSix, LLC to spend endless amounts of time in an effort to restore pirates in thier rightful place on our dearest planet.
</p>
<p>
We hope that this crystal clear evidence will inspire and motivate you to help our cause and by donating to our company, or even compell you to drop everything you have right now and become a pirate. Only you can stop clobal warming. And by you, we mean the pirate we know you want to be.
